This project looks at parking tickets in Los Angeles using the data from the LA City Parking Citations site. Personally, Iâ€™ve gotten quite a few parking tickets in the USC area, and originally I wanted to see if there was a difference in ticket distribution based on city vs suburban setting. However, this data was more difficult to find that expected. Instead, this project looks at several different aspects, such as what car model has the most parking tickets or which agency gives the most citations.
