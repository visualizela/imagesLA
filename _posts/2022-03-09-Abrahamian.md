While many people believe that homeless people live in tents in busy cities, data reveals that the majority of homeless people reside in automobiles. This project takes a look at what conditions the homeless people live in and where they choose to live. Additionally, the inforgraphis convey the cities within Los Angeles with the most dense homeless population and provide details about group quarter housing.
