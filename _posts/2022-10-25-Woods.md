Most people believe that cleaner air and healthier ozone layer can be directly compared with a general population. For example a larger population in an area the worse off the ozone layer , more pollution, and dirtier air exists. This might be the case for some counties but there is a better indicator when looking for areas with cleaner or worse off atmospheric health and that is zoning laws and infastructure. I have created a zine to represent this and show how zoning laws harm or help atmospheric health.
