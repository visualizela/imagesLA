With access to the beach, some of the greatest food in the world, and nearly flawless weather, it makes sense why Los Angeles County would be one of the most attractive counties in America. Unfortunately, this appeal comes with a crazy price of living that many cannot afford. Over the past 10 years much has changed and in this zine Iâ€™ll be using maps and graphs to spread awareness of the dilemma.
