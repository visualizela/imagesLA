While much of the current data on foster youth is negatively skewed, this datavisualization hopes to bring a positive narrative through the work of The Academy Project. By placing infographics atop photographs from The Academy Project's after school program, this data will move from a state perspective to a county perspective to highlight the staggering incidence of foster youth in Los Angeles. Additionally, this series of infographics will incorportate anecdotal personal evidence on the impact that The Academy Project has on foster youth communities in the South Los Angeles area.
