This zine looks at variance in walkability across Los Angeles on the basis of historical redlining conducted by the Home Owners Loan Corporation in the early 1900s. The purpose of the zine is to explore the complications in the relationship between walkability and redlining given urban planning history. The HOLC seemed to have given great weight to white suburbanite populations while heavily marking down urban areas with people of color in their area gradings. As a result, this leads to a relationship where higher redlining (lower HOLC grades) correlates with higher walkability if walkability index data is used. However, walkability is not solely based on if the underlying urban structure allows it in regard to proxmity to stores and restauraunts; is also depends on the overall safety of walkability. Pedestrian safety is often low in Los Angeles, which could impair demand for walkability and ultimately slow progress on mitigating climate change through decreasing automobile use. 

The selected coordinates are a marker for a semi-randomly chosen area of Los Angeles that I explored and photographed, which is west of Los Angeles (about south of Koreatown and north of West Adams).
