This zine looks at variance in walkability across Los Angeles on the basis of historical redlining conducted by the Home Owners Loan Corporation in the early 1900s. The purpose of the zine is to explore the complications in the relationship between walkability and redlining given urban planning history. The HOLC seemed to have given great weight to white suburbanite populations while heavily marking down urban areas with people of color in their area gradings. As a result, this seems to lead to a visual relationship where higher redlining (lower HOLC grades) generally correlates with higher walkability if walkability index data (which uses variables such as land use diversity and intersection density) is used. However, walkability is not solely based on if the underlying urban structure allows it in regard to proxmity to stores and restauraunts; it also depends on the overall safety of walkability. Pedestrian safety is often low in Los Angeles, which could impair demand for walkability and ultimately slow needed reductions in automobile use in order to mitigate climate change. To demonstrate this, I also utilize the LA Department of Transportation's High Injury Network data and overlay the findings upon the HOLC map of Los Angeles. 

The selected coordinates are a marker for a semi-randomly chosen area of Los Angeles, which is around the Pico-Union area, that was graded as "Hazardous" by the HOLC. I explored, photographed and wrote about my experience walking in this area.
