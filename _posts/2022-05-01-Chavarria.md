The purpose of this project is to find the best coffee shops for students around USC. Coffee shops are a great environment to study, hang out with friends, or just enjoy a cup of coffee. The coffee shops in this study were rated based on their environment, proximity to campus, affordability, and quality of coffee, tea, and food. Every college student needs a go-to coffee shop. This should be a helpful resource in finding the most accessible, affordable, and all-around best coffee shop around.
