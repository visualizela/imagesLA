We often see data sets that use convoluted and inaccessible measures of very simple ideas. "A Portrat of LA" is one such example of this. When I first saw it, I was curious to know more about what the "Human Development Index" was and what it represented. Then I discovered that it was composed of several indicies: the Education, the Health, and the Income index. My goal with this project is two-fold: the first was to make the HDI accessible to everyone by explaining what factors go into its measurement. The second was show how different neighborhoods in Los Angeles fit into this measurement diffierently.
