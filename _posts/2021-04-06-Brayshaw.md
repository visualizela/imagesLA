In the three years I have lived in Central LA It is impossible not to notice the trash and litter found all over the streets.  Especially in contrast to the pristine streets of the USC campus, there is such a stark difference.  After my roommate received her 3rd ticket for forgetting to move her car for street cleaning, it occurred to me that I had never seen a street cleaner once on the streets where we lived.  Now that I was doing class online and was always home looking out for them, I was certain that they rarely came.  Come march and still trying to come up with what data set I wanted to work with, I looked out the window at the Christmas tree left in the gutter since Christmas and piles of trash surrounding it and wondered how the city of Los Angeles could let this go unnoticed.  However, unbeknownst to me, it had been noticed.  I found that LA surveys the city every quarter of the year and rates the street on a scale of 1 to 3 in terms of cleanliness.  I wanted to create a data set and zine that highlighted the patterns and relationships between the poorly rated streets versus the highly rated one.  I hope that zine and data set show the readers the pattern of cleanliness in relationship to neighborhood and makes people more aware of it.
