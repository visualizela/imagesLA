Los Angeles County is home to 10,014,009 people separated into multiple cities and neighborhoods of the city of Los Angeles totalling 272 localities. They range in population from 0 to 462,731 and in size from 0.26 square miles to 441.98 square miles. I have chosen a portion of these to depict in my zine for the largest and most populated areas of the most populous county in the United States.
