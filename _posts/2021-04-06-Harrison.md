Moving to Los Angeles and into the heart of the city, I quickly started to notice the extensive homeless population around me. I started to realize that as human beings, we often get caught up in our fast pace lives and begin to accept things without second guessing them. Quite often I see a line of tents under a bridge, or a man digging through a trashcan and subconsiouslly think it's normal. While I don't know how to solve these issues, I want to provide more knowledge to the situation so people can better understand where and what people are homeless in Los Angeles. To do this, I found a dataset that maps out the homeless population around L.A. It includes the count of unsheltered people and divides them into different regions around L.A. I have created a visualization of each specific location on a map along with a treemap to be able to find specific locations. I have also crated a zine to better understand who these people are and what they are going through. I hope this project is easy to navigate and provides the reader with helpful information about the homeless population in Los Angeles.
