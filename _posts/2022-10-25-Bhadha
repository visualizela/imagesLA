More than 40,000 people in California state prisons called Los Angeles County home. It is important to recognize which specific LA neighborhoods have the highest incarceration populations and how race plays a role in the policing of these neighborhoods. In this zine, I will be using maps and statistics to provide a basis for understanding Los Angeles's prison population.
