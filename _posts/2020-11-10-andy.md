The homeless issue in Los Angeles is truly hard to comprehend. Unhoused individuals live everywhere across the county and city. One dataset
that Los Angeles city provides that gives us an insight into how homelessness is addressed is the "Safe Streets" dataset. 

This dataset is broken up into three categories, Green - you can dwell in your car at anytime on a street, Yellow - you can dwell in your car during the day on a street, and Red - you cannot dwell in your car at anytime on a street. This dataset covers all the streets in Los Angeles and shows where and when you can dwell in your car. It is a simple dataset but starts to help provide some context to thinking about where people can and cannot live when they are unhoused. 

I created a series of maps that showed the three different categories by themselves. I want the viewer to consider the streets they travel on and know that some are safe for dwelling and others are not. Seeing this data shows how limited the options are and how space is policed and regulated.
